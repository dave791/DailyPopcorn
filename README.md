CUNY Tech Prep Group Project

The advent of social media has allowed for the unification of people, ideas, and culture. This project's objective is to develop a social media-like application that allows for movie lovers and critics to post, comment, and share movie reviews. Users can also create meetups with others to attend movies together and post pictures/videos of their time at the venue where they watched the movie. The web application consists of developing a login/create account page, a profile page for users to customize by choosing their favorite movies, movie genres, etc, as well as associated reviews and social commentary/media pertaining to a particular movie.
The motivation of the project is to create a space for people who enjoy watching/reviewing movies to share their thoughts, interests and experiences with other users. Websites like AMC Theatres and Rotten Tomatoes are used as the crux of this idea; combining movie ticket e-commerce (externally) and movie reviewing with added features like organizing meetups. Despite the existence of these applications as well as several social media outlets, the amalgamation of these apps into one application dedicated solely to movie culture takes away some of the noise of a "general" social media app while combining the benefits of apps like Rotten Tomatoes.
